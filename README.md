Staticallly is a service that serves github raw content but with the right mime type.

To use Statically, simply replace the 

https://raw.githubusercontent.com 

prefix in your GitHub URL by 

https://cdn.statically.io/gh

and you're done.  Remember though that Statically will locally cache github changes so you need to wait an hour or so if you update the PDF
